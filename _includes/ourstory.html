                    Thomas and Cynthia Fallon founded Piramide in 1981, after college, by working with small businesses in Guatemala and selling Cyndi’s clothing designs to boutiques in the Southwest. In 1984 they opened a small retail store in Manitou Springs and began taking the wholesale orders for stores in 45 states. After starting a family in the 1990’s they focused solely on their retail shops, including a kids store until 2008. That same year they made a trip to Bali, Indonesia and started a fair-trade clothing line working with small family run, home businesses there. In Thailand they have developed a very comfortable cotton clothing line, and a traditional tie-dye line called “Mudmee”. In 2018 Tom and Cyndi began collecting donations for a no-ride elephant Rescue Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand called “Save Elephant Foundation” founded by Sangdeaun Lek Chailert. Piramide donates $1. for every elephant pant sold at Piramide and takes cash donations from anyone interested! In 2018 we sent around $1,000 to her Foundation.
