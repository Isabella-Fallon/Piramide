                    Cyndi and Tom Fallon started Piramide back in 1981 just after college by working in Guatemala with small cottage industries in the Mayan Highlands and selling Cyndi’s clothing designs using traditional fabrics to boutiques around the Southwest. In 1984 they opened a small retail store in Manitou Springs and began taking wholesale orders for stores in 45 states. After starting a family in the 1990’s they focused solely on their retail shop, including a kids store until 2008 when they opened a second Boutique in Old Colorado City. That same year they made a trip to Bali, Indonesia and started a fair trade clothing line working with small family-run, home businesses there. The handmade batik fabrics are amazing art pieces in their own right and are very colorful. In Thailand they have developed a very comfortable cotton clothing line in solids and prints and a superb “Mudmee” traditional tie-dye line, as well as, the ubiquitous “Elephant pant” styles. Handbags, silver jewelry, croaking frogs and fun gifts add a spicy flavor to shopping at Piramide! Both the “Piramide Clothing Company” and “Dragonfly of Colorado” labels are exclusively Tom and Cyndi’s.

                    In 2018 Tom and Cyndi began collecting donations for a no-ride elephant Rescue Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand called “Save Elephant Foundation” founded by Sangdeaun Lek Chailert.  Basically, she rescues both working elephants and injured wild elephants, gives them food and medical treatments and allows them to live a stress-free life on her land in the highlands of Chiang Mai province bordering a river and National Forest. Some of these elephants are in their 80s and all are very intelligent. Piramide donates $1. for every elephant pant sold at Piramide and takes cash donations from anyone interested! In 2018 we sent around $1,000 to her Foundation.
